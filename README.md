# BEWSoftware MDj Library

BEWSoftware MDj is a fork of the original project: [Mardownj][mdj]!.
MarkdownJ is the pure Java port of Markdown, 
a text-to-html conversion tool written by John Gruber.

Due to the extensive updating of the coding and addition of more features, I have decided
to refactor/rename the project, and take ownership.  All previous copyrights and references
to the work of the original developers are still in place.  However, so as to distinguish
this work for theirs, which is still available separately, I deemed this necessary.

## Status
This is a work a progress.  As of this commit, everything works.  However, I plan to continue
adding more features over time.  I don't know if anyone else will ever benefit from this work,
but I do it for the fun.

## Related projects
[MDj CLI][mc] is a command-line program that uses this library.
