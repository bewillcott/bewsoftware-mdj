# Change Log - Markdownj-Core

## What's New

This version is a fork of the main project.  I don't know if it will
be integrated back into that project, or continue as a separate one.

### Version: 0.5 Snapshot
#### 2000/02/04

##### Code review
All the code was reviewed and updated to latest Java features.

-   Where useful, anonymous classes were converted to the Lambda format.
-   To help with clarity, I also ran the Netbeans: Source->Organize Members menu
    option.
-   Cleaned up some code that was either unnecessary, or could be redone in a less verbose
    manner.

##### Extended markdown capability
- Fenced Code Blocks
- Tables
