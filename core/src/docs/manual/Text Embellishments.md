## Text Embellishments

###[#di] Delete / Insert
Being able to track changes in your document can be beneficial.  So, you can now
tag deleted text and inserted text:

- Delete:
    - `-!deleted text!`: "-!deleted text![1]"
- Insert:
    - `+!inserted text\!!`: "+!inserted text\!!"

###[#ss] Subscript / Superscript
Subscripting and superscripting can now be included in your documents.  The syntax is
quite simple:

- Subscript:
    - `--subscripted text--`: "--subscripted text--"
- Superscript:
    - `++subscripted text++`: "++subscripted text++"
