<h1>Markdownj Core Library</h1>

<p>The code-base for this library is a fork off the <a href="https://github.com/myabc/markdownj" target="_blank">main</a> code-base on GitHub.  As that 
project appears to have gone to sleep, I have decided to take up the reigns and continue
its development.</p>

<h2>What's changed</h2>

<p>I am not going to try and catalogue everything I have done, as I have been more interested
in getting it to compile and work, than documenting the minutia.  Suffice it to say, I 
have put the code through the ringer. Here are a few general things that have been done:</p>

<ul>
<li>Updated the code to incorporate features of JDK 13.0.2.
<ul>
<li>Where appropriate, converted anonymous classes to Lambda expressions or even an inner class.</li>
<li>Tidied up and normalized code all over, but mostly in the main file: MarkdownProcessor.java.</li></ul></li>
<li><p>Added new features:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="Fenced Code Blocks.html">Fenced Code Blocks</a></li>
<li><a href="Tables.html">Tables</a></li>
<li><a href="Links.html">Links</a> - "!" to set <code>target="_blank"</code> like this <a href="Links.html" target="_blank">link</a> will ...</li></ul></li>
<li><p>Changes:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="Links.html">Links</a> - <code>[ids]</code> are now case-sensitive.</li></ul></li>
</ul>
