<h2>Links and Auto Links</h2>

<h3>What's New</h3>

<ul>
<li>Link "<code>[id]</code>s" are now case-sensitive.  Having them as case-insensitive just left 
it open to all sorts of problems with no real benefit.</li>
<li>You can now add a new option: "<code>!</code>" - to set the link target to "<code>_blank</code>".  This will
open the link's location page in a new tab, and should make <em>it</em> the current
window.  This leaves your original page still open where you left it, making
it easy to go back and forth between them, or just getting back to where
you left off.</li>
</ul>
