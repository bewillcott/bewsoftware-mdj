## Fenced Code Blocks

This should be converted to a code block (using: ``` - 3 back-ticks):
```
/**
 * Sample class with Javadoc comment.
 */
public class Fred {
    public final String text;

    /*
     * Good place to start
     */
    public Fred(String text){
        this.text = text
    }

    public String toString(){
        return text;
    }
}
```
Now we will continue with the narrative.

This should be converted to a code block (using: ``` - 3 back-ticks):
```lang: java
public class Fred {
    public final String text;

    public Fred(String text){
        this.text = text
    }
}
```
Now we will continue with the narrative.

This should be converted to a code block (using: ~~~ - 3 tildes):
~~~[@prettyprint][@language-java] 
public class Fred {
    public final String text;

    public Fred(String text){
        this.text = text
    }
}
~~~
Now we will continue with the narrative.

This should be converted to a code block (using: ~~~ - 3 tildes)  
with an _id_ of "cb":
~~~[#cb][][@language-java] 
public class Fred {
    public final String text;

    public Fred(String text){
        this.text = text
    }
}
~~~
Now we will continue with the narrative.
