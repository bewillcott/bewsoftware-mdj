## Tables (Enhanced)

Now you can add a caption. But wait, there's more.  It can have  the same type
of borders as your `<table>`.

The single line on top of the table becomes the caption. However, there must
be a blank line before it.  Use any formatting Markdownj offers, on the text.

To add bordering, enclose the text within square brackets: [ ]

Next, you can add bordering to any or all of the tags: `<table>`, `<th>` or `<td>`.
Do this by using the square brackets at the end of each line.  An empty bracket `[]`
means use the default settings: `border width: 1px, padding: 5px`. Alternatively,
you can set one or both of them using that order [bw, p]: `[3 7]` or `[3,7]` or `[3]`.

There is also another nice helpful feature, rolling format.  Set one or more of 
your `<td>` lines to include borders, then leave the rest to Markdownj.  It will 
use those settings in a round-robin way to format the following lines.  For example,
each of the tables below are using this way to format bracketed lines.

Now, if for some reason you wish to use a different format  for say the last line,
or you wish to turn off this auto formatting, then simply added a bracket option
to your line.  To reset/clear out the formatting list, use `[0]`.  This will turn
off the formatting for that and subsequent unbracketed lines.  Notice the last line of
each table below has its own bracketed options.  Check out the results in your
browser.

### What's next you might ask? ###[*](#gt)

Well how about adding an '_id_' to the table, or even a row?  By adding the _id_
to the delimiter row, it gets added to the `<table>` tag.
```
This is a great table
