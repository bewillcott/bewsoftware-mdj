<h3>Paragraph (Enhanced)</h3>

<p id="pid">To add an <code>id</code> attribute to a paragraph, just put it  anywhere within it.  If there 
is more than one, only the first one matters.  All will be  removed from the final
formatted text.</p>

<p>Then to setup a link to it go to previous <a href="#pid">paragraph</a>.</p>
